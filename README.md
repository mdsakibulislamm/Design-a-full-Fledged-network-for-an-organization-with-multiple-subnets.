Project Title: Design-a-full-Fledged-network-for-an-organization-with-multiple-subnets.


Project Statement:
The purpose of my project is to create a university based network. The project based on creating complete model of the complex network by discovering the interconnectivity of the system and subnetworks, which will reflect the Apex University curriculum. This project is about configure a DHCP which is automatically assign IPv4 addresses to any host. Also DNS server ,HTTP protocol used in this project. Here I use cisco packet tracer and implemented window.

Overview of Three main services:
In my project I have used Cisco Packet Tracer for the implementation. There are three main services, one is Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Second one is Hyper Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Third one is Domain Name System (DNS).

DHCP is a network protocol that enables a server to automatically assign an IP to a computer from defined range of numbers configured for a given network. DHCP allows to move a computer, such as a laptop, among various locations without reconfiguring the TCP/IP setting. For example, if a faculty member had a laptop which he wanted to take from his office to a networked classroom to present in class, DHCP will allow the laptop to hook to the network in both locations without reconfiguring the computer.

In this project’s network model, there is a single server (DHCP), which is connected to a switch. That switch is connected to other five routers connected to switch that refer to Academic, Classrooms, ICS labs, faculty, employee, digital lab, and library. Each server is a sub-network. In the DHCP server there are few numbers of ports where I  use only two port to connect a switch that creates  sub-network. In future which can be expanded creating subnets from them? These are the wired network connections. Alongside of those, we I used 1 wireless switch so that one can connect there tablet or mobile phone and use internet service. 

HTTP is designed to permit intermediate network elements to improve or enable communications between clients and servers. High-traffic websites often benefit from web cache servers that deliver content on behalf of upstream servers to improve response time. Web browsers cache previously accessed web resources and reuse them when possible to reduce network traffic. HTTP proxy servers at private network boundaries can facilitate communication for clients without a globally routable address, by relaying messages with external servers.
DNS server is the Internet’s equivalent. It maintain a directory of domain names and translate them to Internet Protocol addresses.
Using this configuration I tried to create that complete model of complex network that reflects the Apex University curriculum.
